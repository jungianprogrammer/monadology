# The Monadology
## by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz

1. The Monad [320], which we will speak of here, is nothing else but a simple substance, which enters the compounds; simple, that is to say, without parts. [321]
2. And it must be that there are simple substances, since there are compounds; because the compound is nothing else but an amassment, or aggregatum, of the simples. [322]
