# The Monadology
## by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz

1. The Monad [320], which we will speak of here, is nothing else but a simple substance, which enters the compounds; simple, that is to say, without parts [321].
2. And it must be that there are simple substances, since there are compounds; because the compound is nothing else but an amassment, or aggregatum, of the simples [322].
3. And where there are no parts, there is neither extension nor figure [323] nor divisibility possible [324]. And these monads are the true Atoms of Nature and, in a word, the Elements of things.
4. There is also no point in fearing dissolution, and there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can perish naturally.
5. For the same reason there is also no wayÂ in which a simple substance can begin naturally, since it cannot be formed by composition.
6. Thus it can be said that Monads cannot begin or end, all at once, that is to say they cannot begin by creation, and end by annihilation; instead it is that which is composed that begins or ends by parts [325].
7. There are also no means by which to explain how a Monad can be altered or changed in its interior by any other creation, since there is nothing in it that can be transposed or conceived, and there is no internal movement that can be excited, directed, augmented or diminished within it like it can in the compounds where there are changes between the parts. The Monads have no windows through which anything can enter or leave. Accidents cannot detach themselves or wander off of substances, as sensitive species of scholastics made it to seem at other times. Thus neither substance nor accident from the outside can enter into a Monad [326].
8. Yet, it is necessary that Monads have some qualities, otherwise they would not be the same as Beings [327]. And if simple substances did not differ in their qualities, there would be no means by which to perceive any change in things, since that which is in the compound cannot come but from simple ingredients [328]. And the Monads, being without qualities, would be indistinguishable one from the other since they also do not differ in quantity [329]: and, consequently, it is being fully supposed that if every place did not always receive, in motion, that which is an Equivalent of what it had, one state of things would be indistinguishable from another [330].
9. It equally follows that each Monad must be different from every other. Because there were never in nature two beings that were perfectly one like the other, where it was not possible to find an internal difference founded on intrinsic denomination [331].
10. I also take for granted that every created being and, consequently, every created Monad is subject to change, and that change is continual in each [332].
11. It follows from what we have just said, that natural changes of Monads come from an internal principle, since an external cause cannot influence their interior [333].
